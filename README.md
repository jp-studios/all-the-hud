# All the HUD: One HUD mod to rule them all

## **<span style="color:#e03e2d">⚠️ Beta Release</span>**

**<span style="color:#e03e2d">Available on Fabric for Minecraft 1.20.1, 1.21.1, and 1.21.11. Features are functional but still in development. <a href="https://github.com/jp-studios/all-the-hud/issues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Please report bugs!</a></span>**

Tired of installing dozens of separate HUD mods that bloat your modpack and conflict with other mods? I certainly did. All the HUD will _(eventually)_ combine the best features from multiple mods into a single, fully client-side solution that can work on any server.

## **Planned Features**

*   🧭 Compass bar (in active development)
*   ⚙️ In-game config screen and settings import/export
*   📊 Coordinates, time, biome, and other info displays from F3
*   🎮 Hotbar tweaks to display tooltips, armor info, and more inventory
*   ⚡️ Potion effect HUD
*   💬 Chat area options
*   🎯 Dynamic crosshairs
*   👀 Auto-hide HUD elements
*   💫 And much more

### **🧭 Vanilla-Friendly Compass Bar**

Never get lost again. Get a clean, scrolling compass with icons for important locations in a vanilla-friendly way (useful if radar maps aren't allowed).

**_Compass bar showing your latest death, your latest bed, and world spawn:_**

### **📍 Marker Details**

*   ☠️ **Latest Death** - Skull icon marking your latest death (auto-clears when you return) and even puts your death coordinates in a private chat
*   🏠 **Latest Bed** - House icon marking your most recent bed/respawn point set _(even Xaero's doesn't do this!)_
*   🌎 **World Spawn** - Blue globe helps keep you oriented
*   🌐 **Nether Portal** - Tracks your latest portal location in Overworld and Nether when you travel between dimensions
*   🌀 **End Portal** - Tracks stronghold portals in Overworld and the Main Island return portal in The End
*   🚪 **End Gateway** - Tracks the latest Outer Island entries and exits through End Gateways to always find your way back
*   🧭 **Lodestone** - Shows lodestone location when holding a lodestone compass in either hand (off-hand takes priority)
*   ⚛️ **Respawn Anchor** - Tracks nether respawn points when setting spawn at a charged respawn anchor

_Markers shrink when distant, and intelligently handle overlaps so you never lose sight of important locations._

_Any updates about your death coordinates or the items on the compass are shown privately only to you:_

## **Technical Details**

**Client-side only:** Works on any server without requiring additional dependencies or configuration (except Fabric). Minimal performance impact with world-specific storage in `config/allthehud/`.
