# All the HUD
### **One HUD mod to rule them all.**

Tired of installing dozens of separate HUD mods? All the HUD will combine the best features from multiple mods into a single, lightweight, client-side solution (currently in Alpha).

## Features

### 🧭 Compass Bar
Never get lost again. A clean, scrolling compass at the top of your screen shows cardinal directions with smooth rotation and precise tick marks every 15°. The semi-transparent background ensures perfect visibility without blocking your view. All markers automatically scale when far away (>500 blocks) and intelligently handle overlaps so you never lose sight of important locations.

### 📍 Smart Location Tracking
- **World Spawn** - Blue globe always pointing home
- **Latest Bed** - House icon marking your most recent bed (respawn point)
- **Latest Death** - Skull icon marking your latest death (auto-clears when you return)
